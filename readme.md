**ABSTRACT**

High power industrial rolling mills rely heavily on the sustained operation of cycloconverters, a type of variable frequency drive. This research proposes a means to diagnose the operation of the cycloconverter as either normal or abnormal by use of time-frequency signature analysis. Various features of the cycloconverterâ€™s input current in the time-frequency domain are identified and used to derive parameters that describe each of these states. A reference model using the parameters is then developed and comparisons in the time-frequency domain to real data are made. Based on these comparisons a statistical decision boundary is delineated that is used to classify the cycloconverter.
